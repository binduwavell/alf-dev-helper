# alf-dev-helper

This is a small project where I will collect a number of small and I hope useful utilities for developer (and to some extent administering) an Alfresco system.

Currently there is only one feature, which is to add a document library action that allows you to open any node you find via the document library in the node browser.

I'm very open to ideas for small and helpful tools. I do not plan to create any big and/or complex customizations in this project.

If you are interested in tools to help with your Alfresco development efforts, I would also highly recommend taking a look at another project I work on: https://github.com/binduwavell/generator-alfresco. In that project we provide a yeoman generator for scaffolding out a project using the Alfresco all-in-one archetype. We also provide a number of useful sub-generators that will help you create common extension points such as Web Scripts, behaviors, actions and content models. There are plans to add a lot more of these sub-generators (see the issues list in that project for details, and don't hesitate to raise an issue if there is something we are missing.)

In fact, this project was created with `yo alfresco`.
